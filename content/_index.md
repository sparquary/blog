# Sparquary

## About This Site

Welcome to Sparquary - my personal digital garden where I share thoughts, observations, and document my explorations in technology, AI, and whatever else captures my interest.

## Why "Sparquary"?

The name "Sparquary" blends two concepts that reflect the purpose of this site:

* **Spark** - To ignite new ideas, creativity, and conversations
* **Inquiry** - To explore topics deeply through thoughtful questioning and curiosity

This combination represents my approach to learning and sharing - generating new ideas while maintaining a spirit of deep exploration.

## What You'll Find Here

This site doesn't have a narrow focus. It serves as my public notebook for:

* Technology experiments and discoveries
* Reflections on books and ideas
* Learning journeys into new skills and tools
* Occasional musings on life, productivity, and creativity

## Behind the Scenes

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Book theme](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) and hosted on GitHub Pages. I'll be refining its design and features as I go, so expect some evolution over time.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something interesting!
